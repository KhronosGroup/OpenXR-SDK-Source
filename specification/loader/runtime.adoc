[[runtime-interaction]]
== Runtime Interaction ==

This section discusses the various requirements for the loader and an OpenXR
runtime to properly interact.


[[runtime-discovery]]
=== Runtime Discovery ===

OpenXR may have a choice of multiple runtimes on a user's system.
The selection of the active runtime is handled external to the loader.
The loader is responsible for discovering only the active OpenXR runtime on the
system, and loading it properly.
The standard process in which the loader discovers the active runtime on a
system is platform dependent.


[[active-runtime-information]]
==== Active Runtime Information

The means of identifying the active runtime used by an OpenXR application
vary based on the underlying operating system and is detailed in the
sub-sections below.
This information is also important if the active runtime needs to be
changed by an external entity (on those platforms that support updating).

===== Linux Active Runtime Location

On Linux, the active runtime information is contained inside a
JSON-formatted file located in a standard
https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html[XDG
configuration directory] or the system's standard global configuration
directory (typically `/etc`), under the relative path:

```
openxr/<major_api_version>
```

<major_api_version> should be replaced with the integer value for
the corresponding OpenXR API version.

The JSON file is named "active_runtime.json" and contains the necessary
information on how OpenXR components can load the appropriate runtime library.

For example, a globally-configured OpenXR 1.x active runtime file might be at:

```
/etc/xdg/openxr/1/active_runtime.json
```

When multiple such files exist, `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is preferred,
followed by the elements of `XDG_CONFIG_DIRS` in order, followed by
the system's global configuration directory. This allows the user's
preference to easily override a global default.

===== Windows Active Runtime Location

The Windows OpenXR active runtime information is actually located in the
Windows Registry (not to be confused with the OpenXR registry) under
the key:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Khronos\OpenXR\<major_api_version>
```

Where <major_api_version> should be replaced with the integer value for
the corresponding OpenXR API major version.

[NOTE]
.Important
====
If using a 32-bit application on a 64-bit Windows install, "WOW6432Node"
is added before "SOFTWARE", in the above path like so:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\WOW6432Node\SOFTWARE\Khronos\OpenXR\<major_api_version>
```
====

This means that the complete registry path to the OpenXR 1.x active runtime
registry value is:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Khronos\OpenXR\1
```

Under that registry key, the value "ActiveRuntime" is defined as a string
value and should be defined to full directory path of the runtime's JSON file.

An example "ActiveRuntime" value might look something like the following:

```
C:\windows\system32\my_system_runtime.json
```

[[runtime-manifest-file-format]]
==== Runtime Manifest File Format

As mentioned before, the OpenXR loader on Windows and Linux uses manifest files
to discover the active runtime.
The loader only loads the actual runtime library when necessary.
Because of this, the manifest files contain important information about the
runtime.
The JSON file itself does not have any requirements for naming, beyond the
requirement of using the ".json" extension.

Here is an example runtime JSON manifest file:

[example]
.Runtime Manifest
====
[source,json]
----
{
   "file_format_version": "1.0.0",
   "runtime": {
      "library_path": "./dbuild/src/impl/libopenxr_sample_impl.so"
   }
}
----
====

.Runtime Manifest File Fields

[options="header",cols="20%,10%,70%"]
|====
| Field Name    | Required | Field Value
| "file_format_version"
    | Yes
        | The JSON format major.minor.patch version number of this file.
        Currently supported version is 1.0.0.
| "runtime"
    | Yes
        | The identifier used to group all runtime information together.
| "library_path"
    | Yes
        | The "library_path" specifies either a filename, a relative pathname,
        or a full pathname to the runtime's shared library file.  If
        "library_path" specifies a relative pathname, it is relative to the
        path of the JSON manifest file (e.g. for cases when an application
        provides a runtime that is in the same folder hierarchy as the rest of
        the application files).  If "library_path" specifies a filename, the
        library must live in the system's shared object search path. There
        are no rules about the name of the runtime shared library files other
        than it should end with the appropriate suffix (".DLL" on Windows,
        and ".so" on Linux).
| "functions"
    | No
        | This section can be used to identify a different function name for
        the loader to use in place of standard runtime interface functions. The
        "functions" node is required if the runtime is using an alternative name
        for `xrNegotiateLoaderRuntimeInterface`.
            | xrGet*ProcAddr (except for `xrNegotiateLoaderRuntimeInterface`
            which must be queried using the OS/platform-specific
            GetProcAddress).
|====

[NOTE]
.Note
====
If the same runtime shared library supports multiple, incompatible
versions of OpenXR API, it must have separate JSON files for each
API major version (all of which may point to the same shared library).
====


[[runtime-manifest-file-version-history]]
===== Runtime Manifest File Version History

The current highest supported runtime manifest file format supported is 1.0.0.
Information about each version is detailed in the following sub-sections:

_Runtime Manifest File Version 1.0.0_

The initial version of the runtime manifest file specified the basic format and
fields of a runtime JSON file.  The fields of the 1.0.0 file format include:

* "file_format_version"
* "runtime"
* "library_path"


[[loader-distribution]]
==== Loader Distribution

Any application using the OpenXR API is responsible with making sure it
can properly execute on a user's system.
Some OpenXR environments may not use an OpenXR loader but instead provide
libraries which directly link with their runtime.
Other runtime or platform vendors may choose to provide a separate
OpenXR loader for debug or developmental reasons.
Whatever the scenario, if an application uses an OpenXR loader, then
that application is responsible for packaging the OpenXR loader in a
location that will not interfere with other applications.
If an engine or platform provides an OpenXR loader for applications,
it must: provide documentation on how to properly package the necessary
files.


[[overriding-the-default-runtime-usage]]
==== Overriding the Default Runtime Usage ====

There may be times that a developer wishes to ignore the standard runtime
discovery process and force the loader to use a specific runtime.
This could be for many reasons including:

 * Forcing on a Beta runtime
 * Replacing a problematic runtime in favor of another

In order to support this, the loader can be forced to look at specific runtime
with the `XR_RUNTIME_JSON` environment variable.
In order to use the setting, simply set it to the full global path location of
the desired runtime manifest file.

[NOTE]
.Important
====
If the "XR_RUNTIME_JSON" variable is defined, then the loader will not look in
the standard location for the active runtime.
Instead, the loader will only utilize the filename defined in the environment
variable.
====

[example]
.Setting XR_RUNTIME_JSON Override
====
*Windows*

----
set XR_RUNTIME_JSON=\windows\system32\steam_runtime.json
----

*Linux*

----
export XR_RUNTIME_JSON=/home/user/.local/share/openxr/runtime.d/steam_runtime.json
----

[[loader-runtime-interface-negotiation]]
=== Loader/Runtime Interface Negotiation ===

The OpenXR symbols exported by a runtime must not clash with the loader's
exported OpenXR symbols.  Because of this, all runtimes must export only the
following command with beginning with the `xr` prefix.  This command is not a
part of the OpenXR API itself, only a private interface between the loader and
runtimes for version 1 and higher interfaces. In order to negotiate the
loader/runtime interface version, the runtime must implement the
fname:xrNegotiateLoaderRuntimeInterface` function (or a renamed version of this
function identified in the manifest file).

[[xrNegotiateLoaderRuntimeInterface,xrNegotiateLoaderRuntimeInterface]]
[source,c++]
----
XrResult xrNegotiateLoaderRuntimeInterface(
            const XrNegotiateLoaderInfo *loaderInfo,
            XrNegotiateRuntimeRequest *runtimeRequest);
----
  * pname:loaderInfo must: be a valid pointer to a constant
    slink:XrNegotiateLoaderInfo structure.
  * pname:runtimeRequest must be a valid pointer to a
    slink:XrNegotiateRuntimeRequest structure.

This function should be directly exported by a runtime so that using
"GetProcAddress" on Windows or "dlsym" on Linux, should return a valid function
pointer to it (see
<<runtime-exporting-of-commands, Runtime Exporting of Commands>> for more
information).

If the function succeeds, the runtime should return `XR_SUCCESS`.
If the function fails, the runtime should return
`XR_ERROR_INITIALIZATION_FAILED`.  The entire
<<loader-runtime-negotiation-process, negotiation process>> is defined in more
detail below.

The sname:XrNegotiateLoaderInfo struct is defined in the
`src/common/loader_interfaces.h` header.  It is used to pass information
about the loader to a runtime during the negotiation process.  See the
definition of slink:XrNegotiateLoaderInfo under the 
<<loader-api-layer-interface-negotiation,layer negotiation>> section for
more information.

The sname:XrNegotiateRuntimeRequest can also be found in the
`src/common/loader_interfaces.h` header.  It is used to pass information
about the runtime back to the loader during the negotiation process.

[[XrNegotiateRuntimeRequest,XrNegotiateRuntimeRequest]]
[source,c++]
----
struct XrNegotiateRuntimeRequest {
    XrLoaderInterfaceStructs structType;
    uint32_t structVersion;
    size_t structSize;
    uint32_t runtimeInterfaceVersion;
    uint32_t runtimeApiVersion;
    PFN_xrGetInstanceProcAddr getInstanceProcAddr;
};
----
  * pname:structType must: be a valid value of elink:XrLoaderInterfaceStructs.
    In this case, it must specifically be `XR_LOADER_INTERFACE_STRUCT_RUNTIME_REQUEST`.
  * pname:structVersion must: be a valid version of the structure.
    The `loader_interfaces.h` header uses the value
    `XR_RUNTIME_INFO_STRUCT_VERSION` to describe the current latest
    version of this structure.
  * pname:structSize must: be the size in bytes of the current version
    of the structure (i.e. sizeof(XrNegotiateRuntimeRequest))
  * pname:runtimeInterfaceVersion is the version of the
    <<runtime-interface-versions,loader/runtime interface version>>
    being requested by the runtime.  Should not be outside of the bounds
    of the slink:XrNegotiateLoaderInfo::`minInterfaceVersion` and
    sname:XrNegotiateLoaderInfo::`maxInterfaceVersion` values (inclusive).
  * pname:runtimeApiVersion is the version of the OpenXR API supported by
    this runtime as formatted by `XR_MAKE_VERSION` defined in `openxr.h`.
    Patch is ignored.
  * pname:getInstanceProcAddr is a pointer to the runtime's
    `xrGetInstanceProcAddr` call that will be used by the loader to
    complete a dispatch table to all valid OpenXR commands supported
    by the runtime.

[NOTE]
.Important
====
Remember, during the call to fname:xrNegotiateLoaderRuntimeInterface, the
runtime must: grab control of the active runtime manifest file.
Functions that should be used to grab control of the manifest file are defined
in the common code as described in the
<<active-runtime-file-management, Active Runtime File Management>>
section of this document.
The runtime must: also determine when to release control of this file.
This may be due to the last instance an application created is destroyed,
the application is exiting, or some period of inactivity occurs.
====


[[loader-runtime-negotiation-process]]
==== Loader/Runtime Negotiation Process ====

Once the loader has obtained a valid address to the runtime's
flink:xrNegotiateLoaderRuntimeInterface function, the loader will create a
variable of type slink:XrNegotiateLoaderInfo and initialize it in the following ways:

1. Set the structure "structType" to `XR_LOADER_INTERFACE_STRUCT_LOADER_INFO`
2. Set the structure "structVersion" to the current version,
   `XR_LOADER_INFO_STRUCT_VERSION`
3. Set the structure "structSize" to the current size of the
   `XrNegotiateLoaderInfo` structure
4. Set "minInterfaceVersion" to the minimum
   <<runtime-interface-versions,loader/runtime interface version>> that the
   loader supports
5. Set "maxInterfaceVersion" to the current version of the
   <<runtime-interface-versions,loader/runtime interface>>
   at the time of loader compilation
6. Set "minApiVersion" to the minimum version of OpenXR supported by the loader
7. Set "maxApiVersion" to the maximum version of OpenXR supported by the loader
   (the current version at the time of loader compilation).

The loader will also create an initialize a variable of type
slink:XrNegotiateRuntimeRequest to allow the runtime to properly respond to the
request.  The structure will be initialized by the loader in the following way:

1. Set the structure "structType" to `XR_LOADER_INTERFACE_STRUCT_RUNTIME_REQUEST`
2. Set the structure "structVersion" to the current version,
   `XR_RUNTIME_INFO_STRUCT_VERSION`
3. Set the structure "structSize" to the current size of the
   `XrNegotiateRuntimeRequest` structure

The loader will leave the remaining fields uninitialized to allow each runtime
to fill in the appropriate information for itself. The loader will then
individually call each runtime's flink:xrNegotiateLoaderRuntimeInterface
function and each runtime then must: :

* Determine if it can support the loader's request:
** Does the runtime support any
  <<runtime-interface-versions, loader/runtime interface version>> between
  pname:loaderInfo->pname:minInterfaceVersion and
  pname:loaderInfo->pname:maxInterfaceVersion:
** *AND* does the runtime support any OpenXR API version between
  pname:loaderInfo->pname:minApiVersion and
  pname:loaderInfo->pname:maxApiVersion:
* If it is able to support the request, it must: return `XR_SUCCESS` and:
** Fill in pname:runtimeRequest->pname:runtimeInterfaceVersion with the
   runtime interface version it desires to support
** Fill in pname:runtimeRequest->pname:runtimeApiVersion with the API
   version of OpenXR it will execute under.
** Fill in pname:runtimeRequest->pname:getInstanceProcAddr with a
   valid function pointer so that the loader can query function pointers to the
   remaining OpenXR commands supported by the runtime.
* Otherwise, it must: return `XR_ERROR_INITIALIZATION_FAILED`


[[runtime-exporting-of-commands]]
==== Runtime Exporting of Commands ====

The flink:xrNegotiateLoaderRuntimeInterface should be directly exported by a
runtime so that using "GetProcAddress" on Windows or "dlsym" on Linux, should
return a valid function pointer to it.  However, *all other OpenXR entry-points*
must: either:

 * NOT be exported directly from the runtime library
 * or NOT use the official OpenXR command names if they are exported

This requirement is especially for runtime libraries that include other
functionality (such as OpenGL) and thus could be loaded by the
application prior to when the OpenXR loader library is loaded by the
application.

Beware of interposing by dynamic OS library loaders if the official OpenXR
names are used. On Linux, if official names are used, the runtime library must be
linked with -Bsymbolic.


[[runtime-interface-versions]]
==== Runtime Interface Versions ====

The current Runtime Interface is at version 1.  The following sections
detail the differences between the various versions.


[[runtime-interface-version-1]]
===== Runtime Interface Version 1 =====

* Defined manifest file version 1.0.0.
* Introduced the concept of negotiation.
** Requires runtimes to export `xrNegotiateLoaderRuntimeInterface` function.


[[android-runtime-negotiation]]
==== Android Runtime Negotiation ====

The Android loader uses the same protocol for initializing the dispatch
table as described above. The only difference is that the Android
loader queries API layer and extension information directly from the
respective libraries and does not use the json manifest files used
by the Windows and Linux loaders.

[[additional-loader-requirements]]
=== Additional Loader Requirements ===

* The loader must: not call the runtime for `xrEnumerateApiLayerProperties`
* The loader must: not call the runtime for
  `xrEnumerateInstanceExtensionProperties`, if "layerName" is not equal to
  `NULL`.
