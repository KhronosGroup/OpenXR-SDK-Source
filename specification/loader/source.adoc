[[loader-Source]]
== Loader Source ==

The OpenXR desktop loader is primarily developed by Khronos, who also owns
the copyright to it.  This decision was reached in order to allow quicker
development and releasing of loader changes for all supported platforms.

However, the OpenXR loader is an Open Source project that does accept
contributions from the OpenXR community.

=== Building Instructions ===

The latest instructions for building the OpenXR source can always be found in
the BUILDING.md file.  It is actively maintained
and should be used instead of documenting the build steps in this file in
order to reduce unnecessary duplication.


[[cmake-usage]]
==== CMake Usage ====

All OpenXR source utilizes the CMake tool to generate platform-specific build
files.  Currently, the loader requires CMake version 3.5.1 or newer.
CMake may be obtained from either the https://cmake.org/[CMake web-site]
or often using your computer's software update mechanism.

The CMake files of interest exist in several locations:

. CMake Files of interest

[width="80%",options="header",cols="^.^50%e,^.^50%"]
|====
| CMake File | Usage
| CMakeLists.txt
    | Root CMake file to set up some variables and recurse into include/
    and src/
| src/CMakeLists.txt
    | Main CMake file used to define and build items used by all source
    in the tree, as well as build all projects under the "src" folder.
| src/cmake/cmake_uninstall.cmake.in
    | CMake files used to define the uninstall process required if the project
    was installed on a Linux system.
| src/loader/CMakeLists.txt
    | The loader specific CMake file used to define the build process of the
    loader source.
| src/common_config.h.in
    | A special file used to generate a header which indicates
    platform-specific items of interest, such as whether or not the platform
    being targeted supports the secure environmental variable functions.
|====

// dunder = double underscore
// setting an attribute to prevent formatting attempts.
:dunder: __

[NOTE]
.Note
====

A note about `common_config.h.in`: The supplied CMake build system defines
`OPENXR_HAVE_COMMON_CONFIG` to indicate that the source should include
`common_config.h`.

If you aren't using the supplied CMake build system, you will need to either
generate the header yourself (preferred), or supply equivalent definitions:

* Define `HAVE_SECURE_GETENV` on systems where `secure_getenv` is available.
* Define `HAVE_{dunder}SECURE_GETENV` on systems where
  `{dunder}secure_getenv` is available.

=== Contributing to the Loader ===

Khronos would be pleased if you decided to contribute to the loader
source code.  

[[coding-standard]]
=== Coding Standard ===

The following sections define what coding standard is in place for the
OpenXR loader code.  Every attempt must: be made to follow these rules
when adding new code.


==== General Format of Code ====

The loader code is formatted using clang-format with the following settings:

* Google style using clang-format
* Indents using 4 spaces in place of tabs
* Maximum column width of 132 characters
* Includes not sorted

Clang-format is required: to be executed prior to committing new code whenever
possible.


==== Language Selection ====

Internally, the loader is implemented using the pass:[C++] language, taking
advantage of pass:[C++]11 standard features.  Since the OpenXR API is exposed
using C, all exported commands must: be properly wrapped using `extern "C" {`
and `}`.


.types
The loader code should: use the standard types defined by `stdint.h` in order
to avoid using platform-specific type defines whenever possible.  Some
commonly used types include:

* int8_t/uint8_t
* int16_t/uint16_t
* int32_t/uint32_t
* int64_t/uint64_t

In some cases, it may not be possible to use these generic type, like when
calling a platform-specific function.  In those cases, this requirement is
waived.


.Standard Template Library Usage
Additionally, STL may: be used in any pass:[C++] source code areas.

.Namespaces
Namespaces outside of the OpenXR loader must: not be enabled by default.

[example]
.Disallowed Namespace Usage
====
The following is disallowed:

[source,cpp]
----
using namespace std;
----
====

Instead, any time you use a function, variable, type or other component coming from
a namespace, you must list the full namespace of that item.  Some examples are
as follows:

[example]
.Valid Namespace Usage
====
[source,cpp]
----
std::string my_string;
std::cout << std::to_string(5);
std::experimental::filesystem::path search_path;
----
====


.Exceptions

The OpenXR loader itself does not internally throw pass:[C++] exceptions,
for compatibility with environments where exceptions are forbidden.
However, since it exposes a C ABI, and the standard library facilities used
may throw exceptions, functions exposed to the ABI (those with names matching OpenXR functions)
must: have `XRLOADER_ABI_TRY` before the opening `{` of the function body
and `XRLOADER_ABI_CATCH_FALLBACK` after the closing `}` of the function body.
(This is done automatically for those functions whose trampoline is entirely generated.)
In normal cases, these two macros are defined by `exception_handling.hpp` to expand to `try`
and a full `catch` clause, respectively. This prevents any exceptions from escaping,
in what's known as a "function-try-block".

In very limited cases, you may choose to disable exception handling through the provided CMake option
or by defining `XRLOADER_DISABLE_EXCEPTION_HANDLING`.
The only two reasons you may define this are:

* Due to a platform or project policy, you're using a custom standard-library build
  that has exception throwing disabled.

* You're developing or debugging the loader and want exceptions to go
  uncaught to trigger a debugger.


.Experimental Filesystem Usage

In order to simplify the file management, especially with regards to loading JSON
manifest files or finding dynamic library files, the experimental/filesystem is used.
This is a set of features which are part of the upcoming pass:[C++]17 feature set
designed to make file management easier.

Since no compiler currently supports pass:[C++]17, most have enabled a chunk
of functionality using the "experimental" namespace.  When used, you can
find elements of this functionality with the prefix
`std::experimental::filesystem`.

[example]
.Experimental Filesystem Usage
====
Using the experimental filesystem in the source:

[source,cpp]
----
#include <experimental/filesystem>

static void checkAllFilesInThePath(const std::string &search_path) {
    try {
        // If the file exists, try to add it
        if (std::experimental::filesystem::is_regular_file(search_path)) {
            std::experimental::filesystem::path absolute_path =
                std::experimental::filesystem::absolute(search_path);
        }
    } catch (...) {
    }
}

==== API Naming ====

Identifiers in the OpenXR API (e.g. types, parameters, constants, etc.) all
follow a set of naming rules, providing a consistent scheme for developers.


===== General Naming Rules =====

Names of all identifiers should: generally be written with full words,
avoiding abbreviations whenever possible, as a concise description of what
that identifier is.  Abbreviation is preferred in cases where the identifier
name becomes excessive in length (usually when exceeding 25 characters).

For example, the class containing the loader's version of OpenXR instance
information is `LoaderInstance`.

Names inside the loader not directly associated with an OpenXR identifier
or command must: not begin with the reserved letters `xr` in any combination
of upper or lower-case characters.  The `xr` prefix is solely reserved for
all OpenXR API elements (both hidden and exposed) and defines the OpenXR
namespace.  Therefore, it must: only be in cases of exposing commands for
the OpenXR API.

Also, as a general rule, Hungarian notation should: not be avoided whenever
possible.


===== Naming of Files and Directories =====

All files and files must: be named with lower-snake-case names.  Additionally,
any C-language files must: end with either .c or .h, while any pass:[C++]
files must: end with either .cpp or .hpp to differentiate them.  Python
scripts, must be named with a .py suffix.

[example]
.Filenames
====
[source,cpp]
----
loader_instance.hpp
loader_instance.cpp
loader_interfaces.h
----
====


===== Naming of #Defines =====

All #defines must: be named in all-caps upper-snake-case and must be
defined to a specific value.

[example]
.#define Values
====
[source,cpp]
----
#define CURRENT_LOADER_API_LAYER_VERSION 1
#define ENABLE_LOADER_DEBUG 1
----
====


===== Variable Naming =====

.Local Variables
All local variables and function/method parameters must: use lower-snake-case.

[example]
.Variable Names
====
[source,cpp]
----
uint32_t number_of_actual_items;
std::string file_path_location;
----
====


.Global Variable Naming

Global variables, too, are defined using lower-snake-case with an additional
prefix of `g_` required to identify them as global variables.

[example]
.Global Variable Names
====
[source,cpp]
----
std::vector<<std::string>> g_my_global_file_list;
----
====


===== Function and Parameter Naming =====

Functions must: use lower-camel-case for their naming and function parameters
must: use lower-snake-case for their naming.

[example]
.Function and Parameter Naming
====
[source,cpp]
----
void myFunction1(uint32_t my_int_val, bool my_bool) {
}

void thisOtherFunction2() {
}
----
====

===== Structure/Enumeration Naming =====

Structures and Enumerations must: be named using upper-camel-case.

Inside of an enumeration, the values must: use the first one or two whole-words
as a prefix (the XR, if present, may be optionally used), and must: be defined
in all-upper-snake-case with underscores ('_') being inserted between a
lower-case and upper-case character in the enumeration name.  Additionally,
at least the first value in the enumeration list must: be defined to an integer
value.

[example]
.Structure/Enumeration Naming
====
[source,cpp]
----
struct JsonVersion {
     uint32_t major;
     uint32_t minor;
     uint32_t patch;
};
enum XrLoaderInterfaceStructs {
    XR_LOADER_INTERFACE_STRUCT_UNINTIALIZED = 0,
    XR_LOADER_INTERFACE_STRUCT_LOADER_INFO,
    XR_LOADER_INTERFACE_STRUCT_API_LAYER_REQUEST,
    XR_LOADER_INTERFACE_STRUCT_RUNTIME_REQUEST,
    XR_LOADER_INTERFACE_STRUCT_API_LAYER_CREATE_INFO,
    XR_LOADER_INTERFACE_STRUCT_API_LAYER_NEXT_INFO,
};
----
====

===== Class Component Naming =====

The specific components of a class must be named in the following ways:

* The class name must: be upper-camel-case
* Class methods must: be lower-camel-case and parameters must: be lower-snake-case
  (just as functions defined above)
* Class members must: be lower-snake-case with a preceding underscore ('_')

[example]
.Class Component Naming
====
[source,cpp]
----
class MyClass {
    ...
   private
    uint32_t _my_integer_member;
    XrInstanceCreateInfo _my_xr_instance_create_info;
}
----
====
