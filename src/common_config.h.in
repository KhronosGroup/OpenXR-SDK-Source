// If this file has a .h.in extension, it's the input for CMake to generate a header from.
// If it has a .h extension, THIS IS A GENERATED FILE - DO NOT EDIT

// To include the generated version of this file, make sure OPENXR_HAVE_COMMON_CONFIG is defined.
// The provided CMake build system does this automatically.
//
// If you can't provide the .h version of this file (because you're not using the
// provided CMake build system and not providing it yourself), you need to do the following:
//
// - On non-Windows, for security purposes, define one of
//   `HAVE_SECURE_GETENV` or `HAVE___SECURE_GETENV` depending on which
//   of secure_getenv or __secure_getenv are present, respectively


// If defined, secure_getenv is available
#cmakedefine HAVE_SECURE_GETENV

// If defined, __secure_getenv is available
#cmakedefine HAVE___SECURE_GETENV
