# Changelog for OpenXR-SDK-Source and OpenXR-SDK Repo

Update log for the OpenXR-SDK-Source and OpenXR-SDK repo on GitHub.
Updates are in reverse chronological order starting with the latest public release.

Note that only changes relating to the loader and some of the build changes will affect the OpenXR-SDK repository.

This summarizes the periodic public updates, not individual commits. Updates
on GitHub are generally done as single large patches at the release point,
collecting together the resolution of many Khronos internal issues,
along with any public pull requests that have been accepted.
In this repository in particular, since it is primarily software,
pull requests may be integrated as they are accepted even between periodic updates.
